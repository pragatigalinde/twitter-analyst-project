The Twitter analysis dashboard created with Power BI has effectively delivered a robust platform for monitoring and understanding Twitter engagement and trends. By visualizing key metrics such as likes, retweets, sentiment, and reach, the dashboard provides a clear and actionable view of social media performance. It successfully highlights patterns in engagement, tracks influencer activity, and identifies trending topics, allowing users to make data-driven decisions. Moving forward, integrating additional data sources, incorporating advanced predictive analytics, and incorporating user feedback will further enhance the dashboard's capabilities and its value as a strategic tool. Overall, this project has demonstrated the potential of Power BI in transforming complex social media data into meaningful insights.
